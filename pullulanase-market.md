<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pullulanase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Debranching Enzyme</li><li>Amylopullulanse</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pullulanase is an enzyme commonly used in the food industry for its ability to break down starch molecules. There are two main types of pullulanase: debranching enzyme and amylopullulanase. Debranching enzyme works by cleaving the branches in starch molecules, leading to the production of glucose. On the other hand, amylopullulanase targets the alpha-1,6 glucosidic bond in starch and pullulan molecules, converting them into smaller components. Both enzymes play a crucial role in various food processing applications.</p></p>
