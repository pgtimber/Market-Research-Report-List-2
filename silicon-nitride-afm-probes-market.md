<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Nitride AFM Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon Nitride AFM probes come in two main market types: coated and uncoated. Coated probes have a thin layer of material such as gold or platinum deposited on the tip, enhancing their performance for specific applications like biological imaging or electrical measurements. Uncoated probes, on the other hand, are made purely of silicon nitride and are suitable for general imaging applications. The choice between the two types depends on the desired application and the specific requirements of the experiment.</p></p>
