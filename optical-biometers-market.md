<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometers are used in ophthalmology for measuring various ocular parameters. The market offers two main types of optical biometers: contact and non-contact. Contact type biometers require direct contact with the eye during measurements, whereas non-contact types can measure without touching the eye. Contact biometers typically offer higher precision, but may cause discomfort for the patient. Non-contact biometers, on the other hand, are more convenient for the patient but may have slightly lower accuracy. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring eye conditions.</p></p>
