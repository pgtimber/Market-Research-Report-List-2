<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Infrared Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>No-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital Infrared Temperature Sensors are divided into two main types - Contact Type and No-Contact Type. Contact Type sensors require physical contact with the object being measured, providing accurate results but may be limited by the material of the object. No-Contact Type sensors, on the other hand, can measure temperature from a distance without touching the object, making them ideal for moving or hazardous objects. Both types have their advantages and are commonly used in various industries for precise temperature measurements.</p></p>
