<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 InhibitorCOVID 19 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are a type of medication that reduces inflammation and pain by targeting the COX-2 enzyme, which is responsible for producing inflammatory prostaglandins. Selective COX-2 inhibitors specifically block the COX-2 enzyme without affecting COX-1, while non-selective COX-2 inhibitors block both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. In the context of the COVID-19 market, both types of inhibitors may be considered as potential treatments for managing inflammation and symptoms associated with the virus.</p></p>
